### Day 1: April 21, Saturday - 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm getting to grips with Node.JS

**Thoughts**: I am awful at UI Design but I love backend work, so I am taking an interest in Node.JS.  Currently going through some practical tutorials.

### Day 2: April 22, Sunday - 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the NodeJS notes app.  Functionality includes adding, removing, viewing and listing notes.

**Thoughts**: I have finished the NodeJS notes app and I have learned about using the NodeJS console and Chrome Dev Tools to debug the code.  Feeling accomplished, but it's 4:31am and I am exhausted!

### Day 2: April 22, Sunday - 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have refined my notes app and I have learned some of the methods of 'yargs'.  I have also managed to set up and configure this blog, however I had to set the post date of 'New Blog!' to the 20th to keep things in order.

**Thoughts** I am finding node packages a little intimidating at the moment.  I am also failing to see how I'm supposed to know that a package exists.  For example, if I didn't learn of the existence of yargs through a video I watched, how would I know about it and how would I know it's something I needed?

Time will tell I assume!
